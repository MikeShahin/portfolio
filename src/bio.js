                Hello, I'm Mike! Welcome to my portfolio. I graduated from San Francisco State University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I then worked a few years in project design, first designing household goods, then designing high pressure liquid chromatography valves used in medical research.
                From there I started my own business which was a dream of mine for a long time, the business was doing well until Covid hit and we had to shut down operations. During Covid I followed my lifelong passion of learning how to program and am now shifting into a coding career.
                The following are the best projects I created during my learn-to-code journey, I hope you enjoy. You can also check out my Github (linked above) to see all my projects and coding exercises.
